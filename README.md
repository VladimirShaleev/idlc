# Sample lib

This is an example library that uses **IDLC** to create a C library.

This project builds:
- A C library ready for distribution via **.deb** packages or package managers such as **vcpkg** or **Conan**;
- Packages this library into an **npm** package for native use in JavaScript applications.

## Compilation requirements

To build the library, you'll need:
- Build tools installed on your system;
- CMake;
- Preferably, the [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/get_started/get-started) package manager installed.

Alternatively, you can use the **Dev Container** provided with the library, which comes preconfigured with all the necessary tools for building the C library and creating the npm package.
